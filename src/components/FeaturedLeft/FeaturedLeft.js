        The <a href="#">double florin</a> or four-shilling piece, was produced
        by the <a href="#">Royal Mint </a>between 1887 and 1890, and was one of
        the shortest-lived of all denominations of
        <a href="#"> British coinage </a>Its <a href="#">obverse</a>, designed
        by <a href="#"> Joseph Boehm </a> and engraved by
        <a href="#">Leonard Charles Wyon,</a> depicts
        <a href="#">Queen Victoria,</a> whilst the reverse (pictured), featuring
        national symbols of the<a href="#"> United Kingdom,</a>was designed by
        Wyon based on the coinage of
        <a href="#"> Charles II.</a> When issued in June 1887, the Jubilee
        coinage, of which the double florin was a part, provoked an outcry. The{" "}
        <a href="#"> small royal </a>crown Boehm had depicted on Victoria's head
        provoked widespread mockery. The double florin was criticised as it was
        similar in size to the crown, worth five shillings, which led to
        confusion. The issue was said to be particularly acute in public houses,
        where barmaids accepted it believing it to be a crown, giving it the
        nickname "Barmaid's Ruin". The coin was no longer minted after 1890,
        though it remained in circulation for many years, and is still legal
        tender for 20 pence (£0.20).
